# Efficient Fletching Plugin
This plugin tracks how many fletching sets your character has left before becoming idle. This minimizes clicks needed as you only click when absolutely necessary. Example: When making headless arrows, you can make 10 sets in total. This plugin tracks how many sets are left before your character is idle.
